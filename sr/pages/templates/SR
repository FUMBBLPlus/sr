The SR Rankings is the OBC Sport's historical objective merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in all official win-aimed FUMBBL tournaments for both coaches and teams. SR Rankings is based on the [Emirates ATP Rankings|http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings] and its predecessor was maintained by [Sonrises|https://fumbbl.com/~sonrises]. Its current editor in chief is [SzieberthAdam|https://fumbbl.com/~SzieberthAdam].

We hope that the SR Rankings soon will be known as ''The FUMBBL Rankings''.
For example, when a coach is #1 in the SR Coach Rankings, he will be said to be the ''best FUMBBL Coach''.
Similarly, a team which is #7 in the SR Team Rankings will be considered a ''Top 10 FUMBBL Team''.
