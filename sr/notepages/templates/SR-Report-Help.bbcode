Because reports have static content which has to be kept in a moderate size, we are not able to give you full list of rankings. \
To resolve this limitation by sustaining the challenge, we publish upper and lower house rankings for coaches and teams. \
Upper house coach rankings contains the top 100 coaches with at least 100 points which is always there except for the first bunch or reports. \
Upper house team rankings contains the top 25 teams with at least 25 points. \
Lower house coach rankings contains coaches who are not made to the upper house rankings but participated in at least 6 tournaments and earned at least 25 points. \
The number 6 for the limit was chosen to keep lower house in a moderate size and because a FUMBBL year is about 12 calendar months long, this limitation requires a coach to take part in a tournament in at least every two months to remain in the rankings. \
Lower house team rankings contains teams whihc are not made to the upper house rankings but are in Top 3 of their roster. \
This rule let coaches of rosters of all tiers to take part in the competition. \
